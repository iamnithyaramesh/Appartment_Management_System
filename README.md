# Software_Development_Project-Sem-2

The task given at hand was to develop an Apartment Management System using the Data Structures taught as part of the course in the Python Language along
with a team of 6 members. The project was successfully implemented by using Binary Trees as our core Data Structure , with the front end modules
developed using HTML and CSS Language and the integration done by using Flask.

The Apartment Management System effectively stores,manages house information(like infrastructural details) and associated residential information
with provisions to track unoccupied and occupied and rented and owned houses.The maintenance bill is generated according to set parameters provided
by the client and is updated in the account of each resident, along with any default fines.
